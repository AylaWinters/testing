## The Ultimate Aquarium Review Site

## Description

The ultimate aquarium review site built with a MERN (Mongoose,Express, React, Node) stack including Redux for state management. This site also uses express validator for authentication and some parallax effects for design.

## Usage

This application is being run by Heroku and can be played at:
https://kelpwanted.herokuapp.com

Using the Navbar, the user can access the "Aquariums" page where they will find a list of all the aquariums in the database. By clicking on an aquarium, the user will be navigated to that specific aquarium's page where they will find info and reviews about that aquarium.

Also accessible on the navbar are links to either login or register.
